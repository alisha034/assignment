	<h2>My experience of learning Web development</h2>
	<p>At the beginning of the session while studying web development,I thought it was pretty hard to understand about
		it suddenly.
		As I was so much anxious and curious about learing web development,later that I put all my curiousity of seeking
		knowledge
		about it.So I took extra time for my learning and got engagemd on group study,dicussion,along with the
		consultancy with teachers.
		After I found myself in that appropriate position which I was looking for from the beginningof my class to
		become totally
		eligile for the further study of web development.In the process of learning
		I learned about web development,coding pattern,design and debugging process.Where web development is a way
		that computers communicate with each other through markup languages and multimedia packages.
		During the classes I got the detailed concept about Html and Css which are the most
		important assets of website or web development.During the study period i also learned about the fundamental
		principles
		of web development.Like as system control & github,simple understanding of the command line,knowledge to use and
		be comfortable in a code,
		text editor,web programming or web scripting skills ,basic understanding of related web technology,awareness of
		principles of interface design.
		CSS properties includes font-size, font-family, color, background, margins, paddings, text-align, font-weight,
		border-radius, box-shadow, list-style,
		text-decoration etc.when creating this portfolio which was so chanllenging and quiet diffuclt too.
		But after,I went through my lecture slides it made those obstacles quiet easier.
		In my learing experience,I enhanced my skills of using HTML,CSS in a progressive way.As further i went through
		my
		studies I explored many things how html and css properties works. I learned the uses of various tages and
		properties.
		While talking about the module let me tell you about about module lectureer he is very kind and friendly cause
		of that it
		has been so helpfull for me to deal with the problems related to regardingd topics.</p>
	<h2>Report on designes used in website</h2>
	<p> 13th may<br>
		This is my first interraction with developing a portfolio website.
		This portfolio website include five html pages i.e(Home,blog,portfolio,contact,sitereport).
		I have made single css for all the html pages cause it was easier for me.
		All the pages are responsive designed pages.I have made hamburger icon which is only seen in mobile version.
		In the home page,I have used background color and my own images.i have used images,colors and hover according to
		my Personal choice.
		In home page there is short introduction about myself.
		The next page is the portfolio page where i have used same backgroundcolor as a home page.I have used grid
		layout for coloumn to place the images.
		I have two placeholder images inside a coloumn and i have insert six pictures in the three coloumn.
		Now the next page is contact page ,In this page i have given my contact Information i have used form to make the
		information.
		In the blog page i have used grid to make coloumn. Here i have explained about my experience of making this
		portfolio website
		and the obstacles i faced druing of making this website. Now onto the last page which is a sitereport page where
		i have explained
		about my experience of learing web development and learing experience and i have included the reference of tages
		and images
		and have the validation of all html and css.
